This is my personal DWM. In this repository you will find my patches, my config.h and the Arch Linux PKGBUILD.

ToDO:
1. Spacing of layout symbol in the actual code.
2. Don't make the text transparent with a transparent statusbar.
   2.1 Move unsigned long real_opacity[] someplace else, use only once. 
3. Implement runorraise? First find out if this can be done on a more global level too, e.g. dmenu.
4. Try cleaning up patches and code.
