This is my personal DWM. In this repositorie you will find my patches, my config.h and the Arch Linux PKGBUILD.

ToDO:
1. Fix the systray patch on monocle mode: currently, it shows a border underneath it.
2. Fix the chatlayout for Skype and (probably not gonna happen soon), make it work with two chat clients simultaneously.
3. Spacing of layout symbol in the actual code.
4. Move clock to center.
5. Add separators between tag names.
