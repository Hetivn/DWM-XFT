This is my personal DWM. In this repository you will find my patches, my config.h and the Arch Linux PKGBUILD.

ToDO:
1. Fix switching from Monocle to any other layout; there's no gap appearing when there's only one window open.
2. Fix the chatlayout for Skype. NOTE: I'm trying to see if I can do without Chat layout!
3. Spacing of layout symbol in the actual code.
4. Don't make the text transparent with a transparent statusbar.
5. Implement runorraise? First find out if this can be done on a more global level too, e.g. dmenu.
6. Try cleaning up patches and code.
