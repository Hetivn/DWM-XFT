This is my personal DWM. In this repositorie you will find my patches, my config.h and the Arch Linux PKGBUILD.

ToDO:
1. Fix the systray patch on monocle mode: currently, it shows a border underneath it.
2. Fix the chatlayout for Skype.
3. Spacing of layout symbol in the actual code.
4. Add more functions to the transparent bar patch:
   4.1 Allow to configure the level of transparency;
   4.2 Have the Pixmap recreated upon changing wallpaper.
